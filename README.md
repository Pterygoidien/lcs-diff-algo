A simple Large Common Subsystem algorithm using recursive & Dynamic Programming with bottom-top approaches. 
Unit tests & benchmark for both approachs. This algorithm is then used for a diff algorithm (to be constructed). 

I intend to make this a microservice which will then be used for a collaborative platform in MedTech.
